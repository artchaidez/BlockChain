ProjectH:
This project combines ProjectF and ProjectG, using Prof Elliot BlockJ.java and bc.java code.
This project is to send a string format of public keys to each process, with each process
storing its key with its ID somewhere.
Note: My code seems to making the same key and string regardless of how the code
is designed. Unsure if the 3 strings on the console have to be different to be truly different
keys.
