ProjectL(not working):
Built upon ProjectK and previous projects. Read data, put them in blocks, convert into JSON
and send them to all 3 processes. Print out the name of each patient (12 total) and
translate each JSON block-object into a regular Java block-object.

Two errors:
1- Need all the inputs on json. Right now only BlockInput1 is being made into JSON ->
Use a switch statement to make 3 files, then use another switch statement to read the.
Ugly and probably not what prof wants, but I'll figure it out one day :(
2- Only reading first peron in json, three times -> it now sending only the first person in
each json. Unsure why it is not looping -> sending strings of the blocks, works but ugly
